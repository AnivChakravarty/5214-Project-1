Use of Data Beyond BraTS
Participants are allowed to use additional public but NOT private data (from their own institutions) for extending the provided BraTS data, for the training of the algorithm chosen to be ranked. Similarly, using models that were pretrained on private datasets is NOT allowed. This is due to our intentions to provide a fair comparison among the participating methods. However, participants are allowed to use additional public and/or private data (from their own institutions), only if for scientific publication purposes and they explicitly mention this in their submitted manuscripts and also report results using only the BraTS'21 data to discuss potential result differences.

Data Usage Agreement / Citations
You are free to use and/or refer to the BraTS datasets in your own research, provided that you always cite the following three manuscripts:

Note: Use of the BraTS datasets for creating and submitting benchmark results for publication on MLPerf.org is considered non-commercial use. It is further acceptable to republish results published on MLPerf.org, as well as to create unverified benchmark results consistent with the MLPerf.org rules in other locations. Please note that you should always adhere to the BraTS data usage guidelines and cite appropriately the aforementioned publications, as well as to the terms of use required by MLPerf.org.
